# trisdesclous_examples

[tridesclous](https://tridesclous.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a tool for spike sorting.

Here some jupyter notebook to illustrate how to use it on public dataset.
Note that tridesclous can be use 100% scripting or 100% GUI (or in between).
So all jupyter here can be reproduced in the tridesclous GUI step by step with interactive viewer.

Special thank to all lab and team that provide there dataset in free access.
It help a lot people writting toolbox and methods.

Tested datasets with tridesclous:

  * [Kampff lab - Polytrode impedance](http://www.kampff-lab.org/polytrode-impedance/)
  * [Kampff lab - Ultra dense](http://www.kampff-lab.org/ultra-dense-survey/) 
  * [Spampinato - Ground truth - Mice retina](https://zenodo.org/record/1205233#.W_QnR3VKjRa)
  * [Brochier - motor cortex -  macaque](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201855)
