# trisdesclous_examples

[tridesclous](https://tridesclous.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a tool for spike sorting.

Here some jupyter notebook to illustrate how to use it on public dataset.
Note that tridesclous can be use 100% scripting or 100% GUI (or in between).
So all jupyter here can be reproduced in the tridesclous GUI step by step with interactive viewer.
